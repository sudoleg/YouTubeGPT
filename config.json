Increasing temperature could lead to more randomness, which encourages more diverse or creative outputs.

        "top_p": "If you use Top P it means that only the tokens comprising the top_p probability mass are considered for responses, so a low top_p value selects the most confident responses. This means that a high top_p value will enable the model to look at more possible words, including less likely ones, leading to more diverse outputs.
