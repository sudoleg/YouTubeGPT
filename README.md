<h1 align="center">YTAI - Your YouTube AI</h1>

## Features :sparkles:

YTAI summarizes YouTube videos and is not the first project to do that. However, it offers some features that other similar projects and AI summarizers on the internet don't:

- **provide a custom prompt** :writing_hand:
  - you can tailor the response to your needs by providing a custom prompt just use the default summarization
- **automatically save summaries** :open_file_folder:
  - the summaries can be automatically saved in the directory where you run the app. The summaries will be available under `<YT-channel-name>/<video-title>.md`
- **choose from different models** :robot:
  - currently available: GPTs from OpenAI
  - Claude is planned
  - by choosing a different model, you can summarize even longer videos and potentially get better responses
- **experiment with settings** :gear:
  - adjust the temperature of the model
- **choose UI theme** :paintbrush:
  - go to the three dots in the upper right corner, select settings and choose either light, dark or my aesthetic custom theme

## Installation & usage
