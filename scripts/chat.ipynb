      "So there's a famous experiment that was published last year by Joe Takahashi's lab, and it came out in Science, and that relates\n",
      "to caloric restriction. We kind of started with this idea, discussing that the rat experiments were done with caloric\n",
      "restriction. Researchers gave reduced calorie conjunction by 20% or 30%, and the rats, and subsequently mice, all lived longer.\n",
      "What is interesting is, in all those experiments, the researchers gave a bolus of food at one time, whereas the ad libitum fed\n",
      "mice or rats had access to food all the time, eating constantly. The rats given 20% less food consumed it all within two to four\n",
      "hours, following an OMAD diet, one meal a day, concept. They either finished eating in three to four hours or had a four-hour\n",
      "eating period followed by 20 hours of fasting.\n",
      "----------------\n",
      "The question arose whether the benefit of caloric restriction is due to reduced calories or time-restricted feeding. There is a\n",
      "timing component to it, as the animals consumed all the food within three to four hours, followed by a long fasting period. This\n",
      "posed a challenge as splitting the food into multiple small portions for frequent feeding intervals would be cumbersome.  Joe\n",
      "Takahashi, who published the first paper in 2017 on caloric restriction, showed that the protocol used in the caloric\n",
      "restriction field created a condition of time-restriction. He collaborated with engineers to develop a programmable feeding\n",
      "system to control the timing and amount of food given to mice throughout the day and night.\n",
      "----------------\n",
      "For example, if an ad libitum fed mouse eats five grams of chow in a day, reducing calories by 20% would mean the CR mouse\n",
      "should receive four grams of food divided into 9 or 10 meals given every 90 minutes. This feeding schedule eliminated fasting\n",
      "periods, ensuring the mice received food at regular intervals.  The study measured the lifespan of mice under different feeding\n",
      "conditions. The ad libitum fed mice lived a certain number of days, while the caloric restricted mice, who snacked throughout\n",
      "the day and night without super fasting, lived 10% longer. This indicated that caloric restriction extended lifespan by 10%.  So\n",
      "that means caloric restriction extended lifespan by 10%. I've wondered about this because recently, you know, there were a bunch\n",
      "of news headlines about intermittent fasting, and frankly I was frustrated. If you looked at one major news outlet, they would\n",
      "say time-restricted feeding affords no additional benefit beyond caloric restriction for weight loss.\n",
      "----------------\n",
      "SATCHIN: Yeah. Then another popular press venue, let's call it that, same study, described as time-restricted feeding doesn't\n",
      "work. Yeah. Right, and then another one, it may be someplace even more extreme, you know, time-restricted feeding only\n",
      "beneficial because of caloric restriction, or something like that. So what you've essentially got are three different\n",
      "interpretations of the same data, all of which are, well, two of which are true, one of which is false, in my opinion.\n",
      "----------------\n",
      "But, what I think people take away from that is, \"Oh, time-restricted feeding isn't valuable,\" which is not the case. I think\n",
      "for many people it's a convenient way to eat because, at least for people like me, it's simpler to designate between portions of\n",
      "my day when I'm eating and portions of my day when I'm not eating, as opposed to portion control. For other people, portion\n",
      "control can work, but all of that is related to either maintenance or loss of weight. None of it deals with the potential health\n",
      "benefits independent of weight loss.  Yeah. And so I think that if we can segment those out, obviously in humans it's hard to\n",
      "know if a given treatment or experiment is extending life because you don't really know how long people would live anyway.\n",
      "Right, whereas with mice, you have some sense of when the mortality was likely to occur.\n",
      "----------------\n",
      "So, what can we say about time-restricted feeding and longevity in terms of biomarkers or in terms of any other indication that\n",
      "people who start and stop their feeding window at a consistent time somewhere between 8 and 12 hours per 24-hour cycle are\n",
      "tilting the scales towards living longer as opposed to living shorter.  This example of this news article that you mentioned is\n",
      "really interesting because that relates to Joe Takahashi's study, because I described that if you split calories and eat\n",
      "throughout the day, throughout day and night, then the mice lived 10% extra. But if you now give mouse the same caloric\n",
      "restricted diet and fit them during daytime, whether within 12 hours or 2 hours, then the mice live 10% extra. Beyond that. Yes.\n",
      "So 20%.\n",
      "----------------\n",
      "So, okay, so let me make sure I understand so that I make sure I understand. If you take a certain number of calories and you\n",
      "distribute them throughout the 24-hour cycle, it's caloric restriction, the mice will live 10% longer. If you however restrict\n",
      "that to the active cycle, so for humans, the daytime, then they live 20% longer. 20% longer.  So, it's not just total caloric\n",
      "intake. Meaning it's not just important to be sub-maintenance in calories for sake of longevity. It also is important as to when\n",
      "in the 24-hour cycle you eat those calories. Do I have that right?\n",
      "----------------\n",
      "So now, still, the story is not over because these mice are fed during daytime when they're not supposed to eat. That's right.\n",
      "So for us it would be the equivalent of being on the night shift and only eating at night, but a sub-maintenance calorie diet, I\n",
      "guess, is the right way to say it. But when he fed mice during nighttime, when they're supposed to eat, and they're getting the\n",
      "same number of calories within 12 hours or 2 hours, then the mice lived 35% longer than they control. 35% longer. So, scale to\n",
      "human lifespan,\n",
      "----------------\n",
      "Then the mice lived 35% longer than the control, 35% longer. Scaling to human lifespan, which we don't know, but 35% longer\n",
      "would mean that - and again, no one knows - but humans, now, what is the average mortality in the United States? Somewhere\n",
      "around 80? Yeah, so it's around 80, it used to be 80. Now reduced a little bit because of COVID, but let's take 80. Okay, so\n",
      "people are then now living somewhere between 25 and 35 years longer. I'm putting some error bars on there. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n",
      "----------------\n",
      "Amazing. So that was really profound. But now, you pointed out biomarkers and other stuff, so now if you look at any given time\n",
      "within that experiment, and actually Joe went back and had a separate cohort of mice, very similar, and so that he could take\n",
      "tissue samples and of course in this case you have to sacrifice the mouse. He looked for, he did a lot of molecular analysis\n",
      "with known markers. For example, hemoglobin A1C equivalent or glucose control, cholesterol, all this stuff. He could not find\n",
      "anything that predicted the benefit of caloric restriction. So that means in this experiment, whatever we know so far, the\n",
      "predictor of longevity, none of them could predict whether this CR-only mouse, throughout day and night, that mouse is going to\n",
      "live less than the night-fed mouse that was going to live 25% extra.\n",
      "----------------\n",
      "Does that mean that there are biomarkers related to longevity that we just haven't discovered yet? Yeah, so that's exactly. So\n",
      "that means whatever we know so far about biomarkers, he could not use to predict. Maybe there was a lot of noise. Maybe he had\n",
      "to use more number of mice to get that because you know, biomarkers are not going to predict in every instance, or there is some\n",
      "error. What is also very interesting is, if you look at the body weight and body composition of all these mice, there is no\n",
      "difference in body weight and body composition across all these different groups, across all these groups. So it doesn't matter\n",
      "when they ate, provided they were sub-maintenance calorie intake, so fewer calories than is required to maintain their weight.\n",
      "Didn't matter what pattern of eating, they were the same weight.\n",
      "----------------\n",
      "So that, in many ways, seems to mimic the human studies where they say, \"Look, it doesn't really matter whether or not you use\n",
      "caloric restriction, or you start your feeding window in the morning or start your feeding window in the evening, or you portion\n",

      "So there's a famous experiment that was published last year by Joe Takahashi's lab, and it came out in Science, and that relates\n",

      "restriction. Researchers gave reduced calorie conjunction by 20% or 30%, and the rats, and subsequently mice, all lived longer.\n",
      "What is interesting is, in all those experiments, the researchers gave a bolus of food at one time, whereas the ad libitum fed\n",
      "mice or rats had access to food all the time, eating constantly. The rats given 20% less food consumed it all within two to four\n",

      "----------------------\n",
      "The question arose whether the benefit of caloric restriction is due to reduced calories or time-restricted feeding. There is a\n",
      "timing component to it, as the animals consumed all the food within three to four hours, followed by a long fasting period. This\n",
      "posed a challenge as splitting the food into multiple small portions for frequent feeding intervals would be cumbersome.  Joe\n",
      "Takahashi, who published the first paper in 2017 on caloric restriction, showed that the protocol used in the caloric\n",
